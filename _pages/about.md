This website is something between my personal blog and a pseudo-cv, you can find bits of code and various musings on tech related subjects here, as well as work related information.

### Who Am I

I was born in High Wycombe, England where I spent a fairly uneventful youth growing up. I began bedroom coding
in my early teens, communicating with like minded people on niche modding and fan-game development sites. 
There are more than a few Zelda fan-games or Deus Ex mods in the depths of the internet that contain my mark on them.


I gained qualifications from a nearby college, allowing me to start a BsC degree in Computer Games Programmer at Derby University.


### SN Systems

During my BsC degree I worked with Sony for a year at their SN Systems subsidiary working on the Vita, PS3 and pre-release PS4 toolchains, as well as helping with various devops projects.


### Climax Studios

I graduated in 2014 and after a short job search I accepted a position at Climax Studios in Portsmouth, England - one of the oldest (then independent) game studios in the UK.


I've remained at Climax since then, working through 3 generations of consoles and enumerable interesting projects, eventually ending up in the position of Technical Lead.


### Outside Interests

Outside of work I'm an avid IPSC shooter in primarily Shotgun and Rifle disciplines.


I tend to also spend a lot of my time tinkering with tech, doing things from 3d printing and solding together home automation gadgets, to starting my 100th unfinished software project.
